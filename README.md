The document reader is taking the text to be read in strings.xml (to do: read text from a file), in markup language, with zoom feature.
It fits the characters in pages as per your device size, and on zoom in, rearranges the pages keeping you on same start of page where user clicked to zoom in. Allows us to zoom out. 
The text to be read, normal font size, zoom font size are stored in xml files and variable which can be changed as per requirement.
